## Experience

1. **Universidad De Córdoba, Spain - Software Engineer, Intern**

   _December 2022 - August 2023_

I had an internship position at a startup called _RehApp_. _RehApp_ is the web application for monitoring undergoing rehabilitation after operations.

As an intern, I worked on UX improvements for doctors. I added algorithms for cleaning graphs from the noise that improve data quality for exercise charts, so the doctors now have a better view of exercise history. After this, I automated reports made from patients’ data, exportable to PDF or CSV. Also, I reorganized patients' history pages, to show rehabilitation progress at a glance for doctors. All libs and algorithms I chose and successfully implemented by myself.

As a result doctors now have a good user experience.

2. **EPAM Systems, Ukraine - Software Engineer, Mid-Level**

   _September 2021 - December 2022_

In _EPAM Systems_ I worked on a software project for _London Stock Exchange Group_. London Stock Exchange Group is a stock exchange and financial information company.

As a part of the AAA team, I was responsible for authentication, authorization, and administration. I updated the legacy Servlet components to run on Spring Boot within the AWS Lambda environment after this our code started to run faster. After migration from JDK 6 to JDK 8 rewrote a Captcha library to support on Solaris. I was one of the few on the team who worked with Node.js, so I moved Node.js code to the new multi-factor authentication (MFA) workflow. As a part of the Kanban team investigated and fixed critical production issues, as a result, received good words from customers and rapidly achieved a Mid-Level Software Engineer title in the company.
