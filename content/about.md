## Experience

1. **Universidad De Córdoba - Intern, PHP**

   _December 2022 - August 2023_

I had an internship position at the startup called _RehApp_. _RehApp_ is a website for rehabilitation after operations. Patients upload videos with exercises and doctors view these videos. From these videos, doctors can analyze the plots of each exercise.

As an intern, I improved this web application. I added algorithms for cleaning graphs from noise (this made it easier for doctors to analyze). I built features for doctors to view the information in a convenient way and download reports in two formats CSV & PDF. These features help doctors to analyze and view patients' histories more easily. I selected libraries by myself.

Stack: PHP/Laravel 8/JS/MySQL

2. **EPAM Systems, Ukraine - Software Engineer, Java**

   _September 2021 - December 2022_

In _EPAM Systems_ I worked on a software project for _London Stock Exchange Group_. Our team was supporting and improving authorization, administration, and authentication.

As a part of the AAA team, I worked on the implementation of new features. I rewrote a part of the micro-service for our failover scenarios. I researched and fixed critical production issues. I coordinated work across multiple distributed teams. I implemented new features on Node.js. I built a new library for Captcha that can work with companies openJDK 8.
