## Concept

Every day I drink water. During coding session or when doing other stuff on PC. Typically I consume a very small amount of water per day. This is not good for our health. If I donâ€™t drink 2-3 liters of water, I will really feel bad. There is also another part of me. This part drinks really big amounts. In this case, I will feel bad during the rest of the day.

To avoid this scenario I decided to make a device that will inform me about water consumption per day. I started thinking about what it could be. So, it should be a device that will be a part of the bottle and show information to a user.

A user interface should be accessible everywhere. It can be a screen on a device, mobile app, or website. After brainstorming, I decided to create a React Native app. So, in this way, I will have an app on all my devices.

Next step is to understand, how this device will communicate with React Native app. A small investigation gave me an idia to make a server, which can receive a data from a development device, and sent it to a React Native app. Also, this server will store all data in database (all devices with access to React Native app must show valid data).
